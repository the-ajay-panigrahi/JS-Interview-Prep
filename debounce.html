  Debounce & Throttling is used to optimized the performance of web app.
  They are used to limit the rate at which the functions are called(executed). 

Debouncing in JavaScript 
    Debouncing is a programming technique used to limit the rate at which a function is executed. It ensures that a function (like an API call or event handler) is only invoked after a specific period of inactivity.

    Why Use Debouncing?
     Prevents excessive function calls (e.g., API requests on every keystroke).
     Optimizes performance by reducing unnecessary computations.
     Commonly used in search bars, input fields, resize events, etc.
